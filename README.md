# mediz-careers
Very light weight WordPress that I created for developing a WordPress based website medizcareer.com. 

This site is a single page application where in I have reused a template loader from http://github.com/GaryJones/Gamajo-Template-Loader by Gary Jones to load different templates on page load and load them conditionally based on the user selections.

For routing I have used jquery BBQ plugin

All the business logic was handwritten in vanilla JavaScript 

Website URL: http://www.medizcareer.com/ - 
This website is created for mainly careers in medical sector as the name suggests. It is a responsive website tested in all the major mobile devices(Nexus, iPhone(5s, 6s, 6 plus),Samsung), tablets(iPad) and desktops.

Important: Note that this repository works for web applications hosted on WordPress platform. For resusing this in your website all you need to do is to copy this folder in to plugins folder of WordPress and proceed with your custom changes. I uploaded this code to provide a reference to how SPA(single page applications) are implemented using WordPress using just plain Javascript and Jquery with out relying on front end frameworks like Angular JS(for routing), Bootstrap(for responsiveness, Although bootstrap was used to generate the carousel) etc..,

Hope this helps anyone who are looking to simulate SPA using WordPress. Please feel to reach out to me @ vamsi.gunturi@gmail.com for any questions on how to reuse the SPA functionality on your website.
